	            If Stan Lee revolutionized the comic book world in the 1960s, which he did, he left as big a stamp -- maybe bigger -- on the even wider pop culture landscape of today.
	            <br> <br>
	            Think of "Spider-Man," the blockbuster movie franchise and Broadway spectacle. Think of "Iron Man," another Hollywood gold-mine series personified by its star, Robert Downey Jr. Think of "Black Panther", the box-office superhero smash that shattered big screen racial barriers in the process.
	            <br> <br>
	            And that is to say nothing of the Hulk, the X-Men, Thor and other film and television juggernauts that have stirred the popular imagination and made many people very rich.
	            <br> <br>
	            If all that entertainment product can be traced to one person, it would be Stan Lee, who died in Los Angeles on Monday at 95. From a cluttered office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan in the 1960s, he helped conjure a lineup of pulp-fiction heroes that has come to define much of popular culture in the early 21st century.
